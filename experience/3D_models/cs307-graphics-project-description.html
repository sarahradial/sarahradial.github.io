        <h1>Scenic Arch of Constantine by Sarah Yan</h1>
        <h3>General Description: </h3>
        <p>From this demo
          <a href="cs307-graphics-project-alpha.html">here</a>. I have created a scene containing
          the arch of Constantine, a fountain, some fancy trees, some tile flooring,
          and some animated fire flies. </p>
          <img src="daytime.png" alt="day time scene" height= "300" width= "500">
          <img src="nighttime.png" alt="night time scene" height= "300" width= "500">
          <p>You can toggle to see day time or night time. For the day time scene,
            there are no fireflies and it is just a bright day. For the night
            time scene. there are fireflies and they are flying around, some
            casting light on to the other modeled figures. </p>
          <h3>Components in Scene:</h3>
          <img src="arch.png" alt="arch" height= "150" width= "250">
          <img src="fountain.png" alt="arch" height= "150" width= "250">
          <img src="fancytree.png" alt="arch" height= "150" width= "250">
          <img src="firefly.png" alt="arch" height= "150" width= "250">
          <p>The arch of Constantine can be seen <a href="cs307-creative-scene.html">
            here</a> where you can change the camera angle. The arch itself is just
            placed in the background of this project. I plan on having more fireflies
            revolving around the arch (and in the scene in generally). The fountain
            is made out of boxgeometry meshes. I modularized it by making a function
            that creates one layer of the fountain. Then, after tree layers, I created
            a base frame (also made out of boxgeometry meshes). Originally, I wanted to
            animate water from the water fountain, but I settled on just animating
            the fireflies. I plan on adding a rectangle light source on the fountain,
            but I have not gotten to that yet. The fancy tree is made from a cone and
            3 flattened torus geometry meshes. The firefly is made from 2 half sphere
            that are scaled accordingly, two box geometry mesh wings, and a light source
            at the lighter half sphere. The current firefly does not flap its wings,
            I hope to animate that for my final version. </p>
            <h3>Future Implementations: </h3>
            <p>I hope to put in more fireflies in the scene, have the camera circulate
              the scene, have the fireflies flap its wings, and the fountain to have
              a rectangular light source in the cyan sliver. I will see if I will
              get to these tasks. </p>
