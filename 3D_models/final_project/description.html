        <h3>General Description: </h3>
        <p>From this demo
          <a href="project.html">here</a>. I have created a
          scene containingthe arch of Constantine, a fountain, some fancy trees,
          some tile flooring, and some animated fireflies. </p>
        <img src="imgs/daytime.png" alt="daytime" height= "300" width= "500">
        <img src="imgs/nighttime.png" alt="nighttime" height= "300" width= "500">
        <p>You can toggle the daytime feature to change the scene from day time
          to night time. In contrast to day time setting, there are 6 fireflies
          in night time.</p>

        <p>Aside from manualling dragging and zooming in and out to change the
          camera, you can press the number keys from 0 to 5.</p>

        <h4>Arch of Constantine</h4>
        <p>The arch consists of 8 columns, 2 side archs, and 1 main arch.
        Using Bezier Surfaces, I created an arch object to serve as the archway.
        The real life arch is much more complicated than the arch that I model
        here, but I tried to resemble the overall makeup of the archway as best
        as I could.</p>

        <h4>Fountain</h4>
        <p>The fountain is made up of three layers of an inner block, middle block,
          and outer frame block. I modularized it by making a function that created
          one layer of the fountain. I then created a base frame. </p>

        <h4>Fancy Tree</h4>
        <p>The tree is made from a cone and 3 flattened torus geometry meshes.
        There are two rows of trees. I simply had a function to make one row such
        that the trees would be windowed in between the tiles. The tiles themselves
        are simple box geometries.</p>

        <h4>Firefly</h4>
        <p>The firefly is made from 3 half spheres that are scaled accordingly,
          2 box geometry mesh wings, and a light source at the lighter half sphere.
          In the scene, there are a total of 6 fireflies, each beaming their own
          light source.</p>
